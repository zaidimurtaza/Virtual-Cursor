# Virtual Cursor Using Computer Vision  

![Virtual Cursor Demo](image.jpg)  

A virtual cursor powered by computer vision that tracks the index finger's movement to control the cursor and uses a thumb-to-index finger gesture to simulate a mouse click. Inspired by Apple Vision's interaction and improved upon the original tutorial by Murtaza Hassan.  

## Features  
- **Cursor Control:** Move the cursor with your index finger.  
- **Click Gesture:** Perform a mouse click by touching your thumb to your index finger.  
- **Enhanced Interaction:** Improved click gesture from the original middle-finger-to-index-finger design.
